| Project Description | [Pitch-Perfect Stats] This project focuses on building a cloud-based football statistics website using GCP and the Understat API. This web app looks to offer live scores, advanced analytics and a user friendly interface. By looking at existing sites like Understat, FBRef and WhoScored, etc., the web app aims to integrate the best features from all the websites while also potentially addressing the gaps in historical data and UI design. It also aims to emphasise security, by potentially implementing AWS or GCP security features when it is deployed with one of those cloud providers. |
